Hi, I'm **Abhishek Kumar**. I'm a student at UC San Diego in the computer science program. I work in the Machine Learning, Perception, and Cognition Lab, where my research involves developing statistical learning/computing models for structured, large-scale, and multi-modality data prediction. I have recently been working with recurrent neural networks and natural langauge processing. I am on [Github][github] and [Twitter][twitter]. [Email me][email] if you want to get in touch.
