AlphaGo beat the 18-time go champion Lee Se-dol in March. Proficient AI programs have been developed for various games such as (some forms of) poker, but this event was on the scale of Deep Blue beating Garry Kasparov almost 2 decades ago.


I found [WaveNet](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/) most impressive apart from AlphaGo.


Loads of improvements in Machine Translation (Neural MT).


Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning [DeepMind] describes a way of training via multiple agents in parallel (AC3) that feels like a common place technique already (at least in the literature I've read)
